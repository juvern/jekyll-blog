### How I got here


I'm co-founder at Quantico Financial, helping startups build finance teams.

After working in the High Growth team in KPMG, I worked with various financial, operational and systems roles across a range of startups in London, including RotaGeek and Receipt Bank.

I enjoy tinkering with new technology and along the journey, have completed a Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree and various machine learning courses.

When not geeking out, I'm probably playing the violin, having a game of tennis or eating and cooking good food.

In another life, I had a stint with the Royal Navy and played in an all-girls rock band.
