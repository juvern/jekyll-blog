### How I got here

I'm teaching people how to cook healthy and delicious meals with little effort at [Lazy Home Chef](http://www.lazyhomechef.com).

At the same time, I am also freelancing with a few startups as a finance and operations consultant in London, building on the experience I gained at [RotaGeek](http://www.rotageek.com), a SaaS employee scheduling software company, where I led finance and operations .

Before that, I started my career at [KPMG](http://www.kpmgtechgrowth.co.uk) where I trained as a chartered accountant and worked with a range of companies from tech startups to large media companies.

In another life, I had a stint with the Royal Navy and played in an all girls rock band. 

I'm also trying to build a life where I can spend more time in Malaysia where the weather is sunny and food is delicious.
