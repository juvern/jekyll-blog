It has been a while since I last made any changes to my blog. I'm keen to start over, write more regularly and just have fun along the way.

I'm going to try and make incremental changes to the blog's theme as I go along and understand more about how Jekyll works. Static pages seems like the way to so I'm keen to give it a try!
