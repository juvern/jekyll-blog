title: Being Productive
---
I'm a productivity junkie. I follow so many productivity blogs that if anything, has actually made me less productive because I spend too much time trying out new productivity "hacks" that don't amount to much. 

Thankfully, I've since unsubscribed to most of them and have managed to gain a few hours back.

However, advice that [Sam Altman shared recently](http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity) really struck me. 

> Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity

I've never thought of it like that so it was a revelation. It made me realise that I was spending too much time working on the wrong things because I didn't give any thought about whether it was even the right thing to be doing in the first place. I didn't stop to reflect because I was too busy being busy.

I think a few days of self-reflection is in store if only to get out of my bubble.
