title: To Sell is Human
---

I have been reading Dan Pink’s To Sell is Human where he makes the argument that we are all “salespeople” now as we spend all our days persuading, convincing and influencing others. I haven’t found that particularly surprising but what I found really helpful was the exercises he proposes.

One can always be a stronger communicator and listener and I have really tried in the past few months to identify my shortfalls. I am getting better but I’m going to try the below exercises and see how I get on.

* I’m Curious - when faced with a controversial topic, convince the other party of my view by only asking questions.
* Take five - when in a conversation, take five seconds before responding

Wish me luck!
